# COM3D2.ExtendedPresetManagement
This is a simple plugin for COM3D2 that allows users to organize presets into folder and switch into them on the fly and allows the saving of presets to anywhere, with any name.

# Highlights #

- Allows the usage of folders within the Preset folder to organize presets
- Small In-game UI that shows up when you're on the preset panel that allows you to easily and quickly change folders
- Robust saving allowing you to overwrite, rename and replace presets to wherever you want (the default, can be changed in the configuration).

# Usage # 

1. Make new folders in your preset folder (pressing the button from the directory changer will take you there)
2. Place or save your presets inside.
3. The preset panel is refreshed and new folders are found when you reopen the preset panel, so switching away and back is all you need to do.
4. Enjoy.

Enjoy and don't abuse your meidos!
