# COM3D2.ExtendedPresetManagement
This is a simple plugin for COM3D2 that allows users to organize presets into folder and switch into them on the fly and allows the saving of presets to anywhere, with any name.

# Highlights #

- Allows the usage of folders within the Preset folder to organize presets
- Small In-game UI that shows up when you're on the preset panel that allows you to easily and quickly change folders
- Robust saving allowing you to overwrite, rename and replace presets to wherever you want (the default, can be changed in the configuration).

2. Place or save your presets inside.
3. Press the Refresh button to load new folders and presets.
